## HTML CHECKPOINT
###   What You're Aiming For

Welcome to your second checkpoint, and congratulations on making it this far.

It’s time to practice what we’ve learned.  You will be creating a portfolio web page. You will find an example in the link below and it will recreate the structure using HTML.

At this checkpoint, you’re instructed to:

use semantic tags.
add a video/audio to the web page.
use local links, lists, or tables.
use HTML forms.
Here's an example to use as a guideline (keep in mind not to replicate it entirely. Try to be creative.)


### INSTRUCTIONS 

1- Create the navbar: home, about, work, resume, contact

2- Create the “about” section, ”work” section, ”resume” section, and ”contact” section (using HTML Forms)

3- Create the page footer.


### What We're Looking For

Use of a Navbar

Use of HTML Forms and a footer

Use of comments during the code

Use of pictures / colors ( creativity)
